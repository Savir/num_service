    Model to calculate difference between sum of squares and the square of sum.
    When this comment was written, it was here solely to be able to provide a .value property that
    would to the requested calculations which could then be serialized in a REST response
    Example:
        The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is:
            1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
        The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is:
            (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025
        Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square
        of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
